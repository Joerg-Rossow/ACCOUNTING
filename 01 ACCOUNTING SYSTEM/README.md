# Double Entry Posting with Tax Accounts

The simplest case of double entry accounting is based on posting a transaction at least to two accounts. Document transactions with tax involve one additional tax account.

Accounting software typically provides a frontend dialog for typing in debit and credit account and amount and also a control code, which steer tax rate, tax acount and other bookkeeping functions. The following code simulates this process and posts transactions on two accounts plus an tax account. It also posts opening entries without tax. The result is a list of postings, which can be analyzed by account or grouped to a journal or trial balance.
